Changes (compared to official TGF home page)


Noticeable changes

- Just like how the color of an item thumbnail alternate between red and blue, its border also matches the item color.
- Hovering over items give the background color an alpha of 80%. The item's thumbnail is terefore visible but with a red/blue tint.
- The item thumbnail’s image is slightly scaled up when hovered, making a zoom effect.
- All these animation effects are also present in the item preview modal, for the six random items below the previewed item’s details.
- Clicked interactive elements have a blue border, indicating that it is focused.
- Pagination is changed: There is a “Load More Items” button that adds additional items to the page. Page numbers are inserted between each cluster of items.
- When the user scrolls down enough, a “To Top” floating button appears on the bottom right, that sends the user back to the top of the page.
- Clicking an item opens the item preview modal as normal. However, instead of just appearing, it fades in from near transparency, and scales down from slightly large to normal. Makes a nice effect.
- When the item preview modal is open, the full-page gray transparent box that’s behind the modal also blurs the items behind the box.

Less noticeable changes

- The borders on the item thumbnails are 1 pixel bigger.
- Spacing between elements wasn’t followed exactly.
- Scrolling is smoother.
- Everything that can be interacted with (links, items, etc.) can be tabbed to (the Tab key). It is also visibly clear which element is currently focused using a light blue border.
- There’s a “Skip to main content” button that appears when tabbed over, and … skips to the main content, which starts with the “View Description” link.
- A screen reader can (almost entirely) read the page as expected.
- When clicking an item while holding the control key (or command key), it opens the item in a new tab, as usual. Now, a new window can also be opened by holding shift and clicking (functioning more like a typical link).
- The official page shows two scrollbars when a item preview modal is opened. This page uses one instead.
- The official site has CLS (cumulative layout shift) on its item preview modal. Meaning, when the modal’s image isn’t loaded, elements such as the description and “show details” button are at the top. When the image is finally loaded, those elements are shifted down. It is more noticeable on slower connections. This page avoids such CLS.
- YouTube embeds load faster thanks to a package (lite-youtube-embed). They appear on screen almost (if not) as fast as images when fully loaded.
- Clicking an item thumbnail brings up its preview modal, but also updates the URL and title to represent the item (as well as exiting out the modal). The forward and back buttons can then be used to switch between previously opened items.
